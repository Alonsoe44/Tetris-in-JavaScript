Lets see what this proyect its about, the classic and old tetris game right? You move the piece and fill the spaces to desapear the rows hard its that?
Those were my first thoughts.But oh boy i was wrong.


The first 3 days i finished the main idea, a box with tetraminoes that let the pieces fall down.
The most complicated part for me was implementing the next and hold boxes because when i first coded the main board i didn't had in mind more code and my biggest mistake was not plannig from the start and not making my code more modular.


Afther a lot of hours i faced more and more problems like creating a "responsive" enough to addapt to big monitors laptops, ipad and cellphones.... wait this doesn't work on cellphones and you may need an magic keyboard(anykeyboard works) to play this game on ipad or any tablet.


Create a decent looking website it's hard you need some basic design knowledge. Elements like typography color theory negative space image making etc are subjects that graphic designers spend years mastering but us as programmers sometimes ignore. We are so worried about code(functionality) that we forget that people just dont use ugly apps/website.(Of course this apply more or lees in your coding department, but i think even for the more backend code it's a usefull skill to  at least interact with the creative collegs and brings us another perspective when programing)

i need to be able to at least make a web page that doesn't look like a 1998 ebay design.  

This proyect was born as a practice to a bigger one I have in mind , here I learned a lot of new things about html css and js, things like advanced grid querymedias and new html elements that hold audio are new tools in my developer belt.


creating a videogame from scratch and realizing all the possible outcomes from the user made me realize how much a game/software developer needs to work to implement a robust code, 
how we can have an array as an squeleton to represent the game Board and the canvas element that prints all our data to the user , this mechanics together with the UI design, music and sfx effects and a lot of debugging are things to keep in mind when planning aiming for the minimun viable product.
